### Usage

This application is used to develop virtual reality web tours from a series of 360 photos. The app lets you preview the generated web tour and an option to download the same as a package containing an index.html file and a static folder with js files and images.

The procedure of implementing a systematic input for the tour is as follows:
<ol>
                    <li>Divide the entire area for which the web tour needs to be created as a grid of rows and columns.</li>
                    <li>Start at row 1 and column 1</li>
                    <li>Capture images using a 360 camera in the order as shown in the gif on the right. </li>
                    <li><b>(Note: Always keep the orientation of the camera the same for every shot.)</b></li>
                    <li>Create a zip file of the 360 images.</li>
                    <li>Fill in the form below with the specifications of rows, columns and upload the zip file. </li>
                    <li>Click on the Generate Tour button to create the tour.</li>
                    <li>Click on the Preview button to view the tour created or the download button to download the created package as a zip file.
                    </li>
                </ol>
