- clean up on download based on session id
- Clean up naming conventions 
- use bootstrap css to improve UX (in progress)
- test deployment on cpanel
- document photo taking process requirements



@app.route('/')
def index():
    session.dir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(dir='static').name
    return str(session.dir)
